**Ingredients**
- 170g Sage and Onion Stuffing mix
- 425ml boiling water
- 500g chicken mince
- Salt and ground black pepper
- Ready-rolled puff pastry
- 4 tsp red onion chutney
**Sides**
- Roast Potatoes
- Broccoli 

**Instructions**
1. Tip the stuffing mix into a bowl, pour over the boiling water and give it a good stir. Leave to rest until cool
2. Add the chicken mince to the bowl, season with salt and pepper.
3. Use your hands to combine the mince and stuffing, so it's thoroughly mixed.
4. Heat the oven to 190C fan
5. Cut the puff pastry in half lengthways and then in half widthways so you have 4 equal rectangles.
6. Place one of the rectangles vertically in front of you and spread a tsp of chutney down the middle. Leaving a 1cm gap at the ends and a 2.5 cm gap along each side.
7. Place around 2 heaped dessert spoons of the filling lengthways down the centre of the pastry leaving the same gaps around the edges as you did for the chutney.
8. Flatten the filling out a little and make sure it's evenly spread.
9. Starting in the top left corner cut 0.5cm wide diagonal strips into the pastry from the filling outwards. Repeat on the right hand side.
10. Trim the end pastry pieces a little so they fold neatly over the ends of the filling.
11. Fold the strips of pastry alternately into the middle crossing over each other.
12. When all the pastry is folded up and the filling is encased, gently press down the tops a little so the pastry sticks in place. Brush with beaten egg.
13. Place the plaits on a lined baking tray.
14. Bake at 190C for 25-30 mins or until the filling is cooked through

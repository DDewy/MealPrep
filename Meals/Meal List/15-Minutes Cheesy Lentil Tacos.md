- 2 x 250g pouches of French Style Lentils (Merchant Gourmet and Aldi do a version)
- 400g tin of cherry tomatoes
- 1 tsp chilli powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 50g coarsely chopped fresh spinach
- 8 x mini tortillas
- 180g grated cheddar cheese
**Prep**
- Combine Spices
- Chop Spinach
**Instructions**
1. Add both pouches of lentils to a large non-stick saucepan with the tin of cherry tomatoes, spices and chopped spinach. Season with salt and pepper and give it a good stir.
2. Bring the mixture to the boil, crushing the tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon as you stir.
3. Simmer for 5 minutes on a medium heat, stirring regularly. Tip the lentils into a bowl and clean the saucepan.
4. Heat a drizzle of oil in the pan.
5. Dip the mini tortilla wraps in the tomato sauce, so they have a light smattering of red sauce.
6. Place a couple of dessert spoons of the lentil filling on one half of the taco (not the sauce covered side) and top with some grated cheese.
7. Fold over the taco so the filling is inside.
8. Place the taco in the pan and fry on a medium heat for 1-2 minutes on each side until the tortilla is golden brown and crisp and the cheese has melted.
9. Repeat with the rest of the tortillas. You should be able to fry 2 or 3 at a time.

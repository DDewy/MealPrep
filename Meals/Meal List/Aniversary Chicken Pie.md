5. Cut a 27cm wide circle out of one sheet of pastry and a 24cm wide circle from the other sheet of pastry (you may have to cut the end off the pastry sheets and add it to the top before rolling out, to ensure it's big enough)
6. Heat the oven to 180C fan
7. Place the smaller of the pastry circles on a lined baking tray. Place the filling on top 2-3 cm from the edge, making sure that it's evenly spread)
8. Place the larger sheet of pastry over the top, pressing the edges firmly together.
9. Use the prongs of a fork to make indents around the join. Trim to neaten.
10. Use the back of a dinner knife to gently make lines from the centre of the pie to the outside edge. You can use the pastry off cuts to add a couple of hearts if you like!
11. Brush with beaten egg and bake in the oven for around 30 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through

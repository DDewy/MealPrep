**Ingredients**
10 pork sausages
1 onion finely sliced
3 cloves of garlic finely chopped
1 tbsp flour
300ml double cream
400ml chicken stock
1/2 tsp oregano
10 sundried tomatoes finely chopped
70g finely grated fresh parmesan cheese
60g fresh spinach
A sheet of ready rolled puff pastry
1 egg beaten

**Prep**
Onion
Garlic
Sundried tomato

**Instructions**
1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, non-stick pan and fry the sausages for 10 minutes on a medium heat until browned all over. Remove from the pan (they won't be 100% cooked through at this stage) and set aside.    
2. Add the onion to the pan and fry for 5 minutes until soft. Stir in the garlic for the final minute.    
3. Stir in the flour until it disappears.    
4. Slowly add the chicken stock a little at a time, only adding more when it comes to the boil. Stir continuously.    
5. When all the stock is used, stir in the cream, oregano, sun-dried tomatoes and parmesan. Gently bring to theboil, stirring until the paresan has melted.    
6. Season with salt and pepper    
7. Cut each sausage into 6 or 7 pieces and return them to the pan.    
8. Stir in the spinach and tip the mixture into a baking dish.    
9. Heat the oven to 190C (fan)    
10. Roll out the pastry. Cut lots of heart shapes out of the pastry, until you have enough to cover the top of the pie. Make sure they are only slightly overlapping.    
11. You can just lay the whole sheet over if you prefer and press the edges into the dish.    
12. Brush the pastry with beaten egg.    
13. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes until cooked through and golden brown on top.

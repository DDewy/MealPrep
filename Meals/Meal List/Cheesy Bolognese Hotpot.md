**Ingredients**
- 450g maris piper potatoes
- Oil for frying
- 1 onion finely chopped
- 1/2 courgette finely chopped
- 1 carrot peeled and finely chopped
- 500g beef mince
- 2 cloves of garlic finely chopped
- 25g Beef gravy granules
- 400ml boiling water
- 1 tbsp dried mixed herbs
- 400g baby tinned tomatoes
- Melted butter
- 80g grated cheddar cheese

**Prep**
- Chop Potatoes
- Onion
- Courgette
- Carrots
- Garlic

**Instructions**
1. Peel the potatoes before slicing them widthways as thinly as you can get them. Place them in a bowl of cold water to soak. Change the water a couple of times to get rid of the starch.
2. Heat a good drizzle of oil in a large, deep non-stick pan that can go on the hob and in the oven (don't worry if you don't have one, you can transfer the filling to an ovenproof dish to finish.)
3. Add the onion, carrot and courgette. Fry on a medium heat for 5 minutes until starting to soften.
4. Add the beef mince and garlic, fry for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until the beef is browned. Drain off any excess fat
5. Add the gravy granules and 400ml boiling water to a measuring jug. Stir until the gravy has dissolved
6. Add the mixed herbs, tinned tomatoes and gravy. Season with salt and pepper, give it a good stir squashing the tomatoes as you go.
7. Bring to the boil, simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
8. Drain and dry the potatoes in a clean tea towel or kitchen roll. Lay the sliced potatoes on top, each one slightly overlapping the next.
9. Brush with melted butter and bake in the oven at 200C for 25 mins
10. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with cheese and return to the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the potato and the beef are cooked.

**Notes**
Removing Bacon as it's quite a meaty meal

**Ingredients**
- 500g maris piper potatoes
- Oil for frying
- 8 lincolnshire sausages
- 200g smoked bacon lardons
- 1 red onion finely sliced
- 100g spring greens tough stems removed and finely sliced
- 2 cloves of garlic finely chopped
- 2 tbsp plain flour
- 1 tbsp tomato puree
- 500ml chicken stock
- 400g tin baby tomatoes
- 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh rosemary
- 20g melted butter
- 80g grated cheddar cheese
**Prep**
- Potatoes
- sausages 
- Onion 
- Spring greens
- Garlic 
- Rosemary 
**Instructions**
1. Peel the potatoes before slicing them widthways as thinly as you can get them. Place them in a bowl of cold water to soak. Change the water a couple of times to get rid of the starch.
2. Heat a good drizzle of oil in a large, deep non-stick pan that can go on the hob and in the oven (don't worry if you don't have one, you can transfer the filling to an ovenproof dish to finish.)
3. Slice the sausage skins and discard them. Tear each sausage into 3 equal pieces and add to the pan with the bacon lardons. Fry for 5-7 minutes on a medium heat, turning over regularly until the sausage is browned (it won't be cooked through at this stage) and the bacon is starting to crisp.
4. Remove from the pan and set aside.
5. Add a little more oil if needed, before adding the onion and the spring greens to the pan.
6. Fry for 5 minutes, stirring regularly until soft. Add the garlic to the pan for the final minute.
7. Stir in the flour and tomato puree and fry for 1 minute.
8. Add half the stock and stir continuously until it thickens and comes to the boil. Repeat with the rest of the stock.
9. Stir in the tinned tomatoes and gently pop them with the back of a spoon. Stir in the rosemary and season. Return the sausage and bacon to the pan.
10. Gently bring to the boil.
11. Drain and dry the potatoes in a clean tea towel. Lay the sliced potatoes on top, each one slightly overlapping the next.
12. Brush with melted butter and bake in the oven for 40 minutes or until the potato is cooked. Bake at 180c fan
13. Sprinkle with grated cheese and grill until you have a golden crispy top!

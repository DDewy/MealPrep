**Prep**

**Instructions**
1. Place the potatoes in a pan of cold salted water. Bring to the boil before simmering until tender enough to mash.
2. Untwist the joins in the sausages and use your hands to gently push the sausage meat together through the empty section until you have one long sausage encased in skin.
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large non-stick pan.
4. Coil the sausage starting from the middle and working outwards.
5. Fry on a medium heat for 4 minutes, until starting to brown.
6. Carefully turn the sausage coil over and fry for another 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and place in an oven proof dish . The sausage won't be cooked through at this stage.
7. Heat a little more oil in the pan and add the red onion. Fry on a medium heat for 5 minutes.
8. Stir in the kale and fry for a further 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until soft and starting to colour.
9. Stir in the honey and mustard. Add the flour and stir on a heat until it has disappeared and the mixture is starting to bubble.
10. Slowly add the chicken stock a little at a time, stirring continuously and bringing it to the boil each time before adding more.
11. Stir in the drained cannellini beans and season with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture over the sausages and spread evenly.
12. Heat the oven to 200C fan
13. Pour the gravy over the sausages and spread evenly.
14. Drain the potatoes. Add a knob of butter and a splash of milk. Season with salt and pepper and mash until smooth.
15. Cover the top of the sausage and gravy with mashed potato. (I use and ice cream scoop) Use a fork to spread it evenly over the top until covered.
16. Cover in grated cheddar cheese. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown and the sausages are cooked through

**Prep**

**Instructions**
1. Heat the oil in your sauté pan over a high heat.
2. Remove the sausages from their skins and plop into the pan in small chunks, (the easiest way to do this is slice through the skin lengthways and squish out the sausage meat). Turn up the heat and let everything fry for 5 minutes until the sausage chunks are golden .
3. Add the garlic, onion and peppers and cook for 5 minutes until the onion is softened.
4. Add the tomatoes, tomato puree, oregano, chilli flakes, stock and orzo, put the lid on and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the orzo is cooked through, stirring occasionally. (If the mixture becomes too dry before the orzo is cooked, add a splash of water.)
5. Before serving, stir in the cream cheese, sprinkle over the parmesan and shredded basil.

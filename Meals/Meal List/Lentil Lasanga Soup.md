**Prep**

**Instructions**
1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large non-stick pan with a lid. Add the onion and fry for 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and honey and fry for 1 minute.
2. Stir in the sun-dried tomato paste, dried mixed herbs, lentils and tinned tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon.
3. Add the beef stock and season with salt and pepper.
4. Use a hand whisk to half blitz the mixture, so that it thickens, but roughly half of the lentil and tomatoes are still whole. Bring it to the boil.
5. Break the lasagne sheet into bite size pieces and add them to the pan. Simmer with the lid on for 10 minutes or until tender.
6. Mix the grated cheese and soft cheese together. Add to the pan and stir until creamy and melted.
7. Divide between 4 bowls and finished with a little drizzle of soft cheese watered down with a little milk if you like

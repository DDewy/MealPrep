**Ingredients**
- 2 blocks of halloumi (cut carefully in half lengthways)
- 1 large egg beaten
- A large handful of fresh or panko breadcrumbs

**Prep**

**Instructions**
1. Place the halloumi quarters in boiling water and leave to soak for 15 minutes.
2. Carefully lift them from the pan (one at a time, leave the rest in while you bread the halloumi) and place them on a double sheet of kitchen roll. 
3. Place more kitchen roll on top of the halloumi and gently roll it out. When it's thin and double the size leave it to cool completely before moving.
4. Roll in flour until coated then tap off excess
5. Dip it in beaten egg, then place on a plate of breadcrumbs, making sure each side is covered.
6. Repeat with the rest of the halloumi.
7. Fry for a couple of minutes on each side until crisp and golden brown.
